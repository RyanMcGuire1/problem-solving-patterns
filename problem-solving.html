	//1. Understand the Problem

    //EX: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.

	/*
		Restate the question: take a string, count the characters, return how many of each character
		What are my inputs: String, could be a sentence, alphanumeric characters (str)
		What are my outputs: object with char as key and count as value, (charCount)
		Can outputs be determined from inputs, enough info to start: Yes

	*/



    //2. Explore Concrete Examples

	//EX: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each alphanumeric character in the string.

	/*
		simple: countChars("aaaa") => {a : 4}

		complex: countChars("hello hey!) => ?
	*/



	//3. Break it Down

    //EX: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each alphanumeric character in the string.

    /*

	*/
		// function countChars(str){
			// make a bucket object
			// loop through string to get chars
			// check if character is alphanumeric
			// If it is, add to object
			// return the object
		// }


    //4. Solve || Simplify

    //EX: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each alphanumeric character in the string.
	function countChars(str){
		// make a bucket object
		let charCount = {};
		// loop through string to get chars
		for (let char of str){

		}
		// check if character is alphanumeric
		// lowercase each char
		char = char.toLowerCase();

		//add char to obj
		if(!charCount[char]){
			charCount[char] = 1;
		} else {
			charCount[char]++;
		}

		// If it is, add to object
		// return the object
		return charCount;
	}




	//5. Look Back and Refactor

    //EX: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each alphanumeric character in the string.
